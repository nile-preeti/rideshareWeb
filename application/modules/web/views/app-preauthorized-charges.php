         <h3>Dear Rider's,</h3>   
         
         
         
        
         
         <p>We hope this message finds you well. As part of our commitment to ensuring a secure and efficient experience for our users, we would like to inform you about our Authorization and Capture process before you request a ride on RideshareRates.</p>
         <p><b>Authorization Process:</b></p>
			<p>When you initiate a ride request, our system performs a pre-authorization check on your linked payment method to ensure its validity and availability of funds. This is a standard procedure and does not result in an actual charge at this stage.</p>
         
         <p><strong>Capture Process:</strong></p>
			<p>Upon successful completion of your ride, the pre-authorized amount will be captured, and the applicable charges for the ride will be deducted from your account. This ensures a seamless and hassle-free payment process after each ride.</p>
         <p><strong>Important Points to Note:</strong></p>
			<ol>
			  <li>The pre-authorization amount may vary based on factors such as ride distance, time, and additional services.</li>
			  <li>In the event of a cancellation, the pre-authorization hold will be released or charged if the Cancellation surpasses 5 minutes, you will be charged $10 for (Electric/Luxury Lines) or $150 for (Exotic, Rare, Sprinter, Classic, Vintage, Armored Lines.)</li>
			  <li>Please ensure that your linked payment method has sufficient funds to cover the ride/cancelation costs.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>This process is designed to enhance the overall transparency and security of transactions on RideshareRates.
